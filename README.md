# Euler Problems
A collection of problems from [Project Euler](projecteuler.net).
The goal is to provide a less painful entry point for students
wanting to use Scala to solve these problems.

## Usage
All code lives within `src/test/scala/com/bsamaripa/euler`.
Your tests and implementations will go here, incidated by TODOs.

To work on a specific problem, use the sbt testOnly
```sh
sbt testOnly com.bsamaripa.euler.Problemxxx
```
